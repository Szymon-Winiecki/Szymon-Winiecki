### Machine Learning

- [Network anomaly detection](https://github.com/Szymon-Winiecki/network-anomaly-detection-research)

    Research repository for master's thesis on Anomaly detection in network traffic using autoencoders and clustering. Five autoencoder-based models have been implemented along with multiple network datasets preprocessing and novel cross-validation-inspired algorithm for semi-supervised learning. 
    The research involved models and methods implementation, hyperparameters tuning, evaluating models' quality, analyze latent space of diffrent AEs and examine impact of combining AEs with clustering method in semi-supervised intrusion detection systems.
